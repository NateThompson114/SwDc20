## Step 1: Determine Level and Type

- CR 1/8 to 1/4: Level 1
- CR 1/2 to 1: Level 2
- CR 2: Level 3
- For higher CRs, continue increasing the level accordingly.

Determine the monster type: Minion, Low, Mid, High, Boss, or Solo.

## Step 2: Set Base Statistics

Use the following baseline for a Level 1 monster (adjust based on type):

| Statistic | Minion | Low | Mid | High | Boss | Solo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HP | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| PD | 10 | 8 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 16 |
| MD | 8 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 |
| DR | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Attack | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 |
| Damage | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| Speed | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 7 |
| AP | 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 8 |

## Step 3: Determine Attributes

Convert 5e attributes to DC20 attributes:

- Might: (STR + CON) / 2, rounded down
- Agility: DEX
- Charisma: CHA
- Intelligence: (INT + WIS) / 2, rounded down

Attribute scale in DC20:
-2 (Very low), -1 (Low), 0 (Average), 1 (Above average), 2 (High), 3 (Very high)

## Step 4: Adjust Health

Adjust the base HP from Step 2 if necessary, considering the monster's Might score and its role in combat.

## Step 5: Calculate Defenses

PD = 8 + Combat Mastery + Agility + Armor Bonus
MD = 8 + Combat Mastery + Charisma + Intelligence
Combat Mastery (CM) = 1/2 monster's level, rounded up

## Step 6: Set Damage

Adjust the base damage from Step 2 if necessary, based on the monster's role and abilities.

## Step 7: Adjust Speed

Default is 5, but adjust based on the 5e monster's speed:

- 25 ft or less: 4
- 30-35 ft: 5
- 40-45 ft: 6
- 50 ft or more: 7+

## Step 8: Add Features

Convert 5e special abilities to DC20 Features. Consider using Quick Features from the Monster Starter Pack:

Offense:

- Cleave, Rampage, Enrage

Defense:

- Regeneration, Resistance, Shielded

Utility:

- Shot Caller, Inspire, Walls

## Step 9: Set Skills

Give the monster skill bonuses based on its attributes and role. Remember:

- Prime Modifier = Highest Attribute score
- Skill bonus = Prime Modifier + Skill Mastery (usually +2 for one level of mastery)

## Step 10: Finalize Actions

Most monsters should have 1-2 main actions. Use the following format:
(AP Cost) Action Name: Range, Damage Type, additional effects
Example: (1) Bite: Melee, 2 Piercing

Add Attack Enhancements as needed, costing 1 AP each. Consider adding Save effects, such as:

- Knockback, Slow, Expose, Hinder, Impair, Daze, Grapple, Bleed, Burn

## Step 11: Review and Adjust

Compare your converted monster to the DC20 examples and the Monster Stat Ranges. Adjust as needed to ensure balance.

Remember:

- Monsters can use all Maneuvers (Attack, Save, Defense, Grapple) that PCs can.
- Consider adding Passive effects to make the monster more interesting.
- Use the Monster Difficulties as a guide for creating varied encounters.
