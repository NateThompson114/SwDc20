# D&D 5e to DC20 Monster Conversion Guide (v0.10)

## Step 1: Determine Level and Type
- CR 0: Novice or Level 0
- CR 1/8 to 1/4: Level 1
- CR 1/2 to 1: Level 2
- CR 2: Level 3
- For higher CRs, continue increasing the level accordingly.

Determine the monster type: Minion, Low, Mid, High, Boss, or Solo.

### Novice and Level 0 Conversions
For very low CR creatures (0 and some 1/8), consider converting them to Novice or Level 0 monsters:
- Novice: For the weakest creatures or to represent untrained individuals
- Level 0: For creatures slightly stronger than Novice but not quite Level 1

## Step 2: Set Base Statistics
Use the following baseline for monsters (adjust based on type):

| Statistic | Novice | Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| HP        | 3-5    | 5-7     | 5-10    | 15-20   | 20-25   |
| PD        | 8-10   | 9-11    | 10-12   | 12-14   | 13-15   |
| MD        | 5-8    | 6-9     | 8-10    | 10-12   | 11-13   |
| DR        | 0      | 0       | 0-1     | 0-1     | 0-1     |
| Attack    | +2     | +3      | +4      | +4      | +5      |
| Damage    | 0-1*   | 1       | 1-2     | 2-3     | 2-3     |
| Speed     | 5      | 5       | 5       | 5       | 5       |
| AP        | 4      | 4       | 4       | 4       | 4       |

*Novice creatures with 0 base damage can only deal damage through Heavy Hits or special features.

## Step 3: Determine Attributes
Convert 5e attributes to DC20 attributes:
- Might: (STR + CON) / 2, rounded down
- Agility: DEX
- Charisma: CHA
- Intelligence: (INT + WIS) / 2, rounded down

Attribute scale in DC20:
-3 (Extremely low), -2 (Very low), -1 (Low), 0 (Average), 1 (Above average), 2 (High), 3 (Very high)

For Novice and Level 0 creatures, cap attributes at 2.

## Step 4: Adjust Health
Adjust the base HP from Step 2 if necessary, considering the monster's Might score and its role in combat.

## Step 5: Calculate Defenses
PD = 8 + Combat Mastery + Agility + Armor Bonus
MD = 8 + Combat Mastery + Charisma + Intelligence
Combat Mastery (CM):
- Novice: 0
- Level 0: 1
- Level 1+: 1/2 monster's level, rounded up

## Step 6: Set Damage
Adjust the base damage from Step 2 if necessary, based on the monster's role and abilities.

## Step 7: Adjust Speed
Default is 5, but adjust based on the 5e monster's speed:
- 20 ft or less: 3
- 25-35 ft: 4-5
- 40-45 ft: 6
- 50 ft or more: 7+

For flying speeds, generally add 1-2 to the ground speed.

## Step 8: Add Features
Convert 5e special abilities to DC20 Features. Consider using Quick Features from the Monster Starter Pack or adapting class features.

## Step 9: Set Skills
Give the monster skill bonuses based on its attributes and role. Remember:
- Prime Modifier = Highest Attribute score
- Skill bonus = Prime Modifier + Skill Mastery (usually +2 for one level of mastery)

For Novice and Level 0 creatures, limit skill bonuses to +4 maximum.

## Step 10: Finalize Actions
Most monsters should have 1-2 main actions. Use the following format:
(AP Cost) Action Name: Range, Damage Type, additional effects

Add Attack Enhancements as needed, costing 1 AP each.

For Novice and Level 0 creatures, limit actions to 1-2 and keep enhancements simple.

## Step 11: Review and Adjust
Compare your converted monster to the DC20 examples and the Monster Stat Ranges. Adjust as needed to ensure balance.

## Minion Rules
For weaker creatures or to create large groups of enemies:
- Reduce HP to 1
- Keep other stats the same
- Simplify actions and features

Remember:
- Monsters can use all Maneuvers (Attack, Save, Defense, Grapple) that PCs can.
- Consider adding Passive effects to make the monster more interesting.
- Use the Monster Difficulties as a guide for creating varied encounters.
